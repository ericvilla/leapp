Leapp is your everyday companion to access your cloud; designed to work with Cloud Providers APIs, CLIs, and SDKs.
It's a software that securely stores your access information and generates temporary credential sets to access your cloud ecosystem from your local machine.

**For example, while using the AWS CLI it may become annoying to switch to a different profile or use the --profile argument before issuing every command.**

Leapp lets you have a new set of credentials and give access to that account with a click.

Leapp also will manage Federated access through Identity Provides.

# Key features

- **Switch account with a click**: collect all your cloud accounts access data in a single place and connect straight away. Leverage cloud RBAC to impersonate your roles in a click, and don’t waste time manually manage or edit your credentials file.
- **Straight programmatic access via SSO**: leverage your company identity to access your environment through federated single sign-on. No more credentials management. Leapp allows you to get to your cloud resources with your company email and password. Scroll down for our [supported use cases](#supported-cloud-providers).
- **Clean credentials file**: ever wondered what someone can do by stealing your credentials file? We got you covered. We erase these files when you close Leapp and regenerate them when you open it! Leave your desk and get a coffee at ease.
- **Automatic credentials management**: move freely across your multi-cloud environment as Leapp automatically manages your access credentials for you. It handles temporary keys generation, rotation, and auto-renew to comply with security best-practices.
- **Ease federation with truster accounts**: federating each account is a pain so why don’t use truster accounts to grant access easier and painlessly? We use your federated role as a gateway to all trusted roles in all other accounts! Seems great, isn’t it? See our [documentation](https://github.com/Noovolari/leapp/blob/master/.github/GLOSSARY.md#trusting) to get more info.
- **MFA support enabled**: access AWS users and services even when they have MFA device enabled on AWS console.
- **HTTP/HTTPS in-app proxy configuration:** allow Leapp to forward in-app HTTP/HTTPS traffic to the specified Proxy Server.

# Installation

Get [here](https://github.com/Noovolari/leapp/releases/latest) the latest release.

To install the compiled version, choose the one for your **OS** and simply **double-click** on the executable.

# Use Cases

Our use cases are hereby presented to give you a hint on how Leapp can be of help depending on the type of setup 
you have in your company and what kind of credentials you need to get.

#### AWS Plain Access

Store AWS IAM User’s Access Keys in your System Vault through Leapp. 
Leapp automatically manages Access Key ID and Secret Access Key in your AWS credentials 
generating temporary credentials form them.
**No credentials** are stored in Leapp please see [Vault strategy](#vault-strategy)

![Plain Access Usecase](.github/images/plain-gif.gif)

See setup [tutorial](.github/tutorials/TUTORIALS.md)

#### AWS Federated Access

Leverage company identity to access environment through federated single sign-on. 
No more credentials management is needed. Leapp allows to get to cloud resources with 
company email and password.

![Plain Access Usecase](.github/images/federated-gif.gif)

See setup [tutorial](.github/tutorials/TUTORIALS.md)

#### AWS Truster Access

Federating each account is a pain so use truster accounts to grant access easier and painlessly.
We use federated role as a gateway to all trusted roles in all other accounts.

![Plain Access Usecase](.github/images/truster-gif.gif)

See setup [tutorial](.github/tutorials/TUTORIALS.md)

#### Azure Access

Use Leapp to do Single Sign On with Google on Azure AD to get access to your subscriptions in Azure Cloud.
Leapp Manage the login process for you to have Azure CLI ready to be used.

# Rotating Credentials

Leapp is created with security in mind: that is, **NO** credentials are saved in our system whatsoever. 
Nor in code neither in our configuration file 

# Vault Strategy

On leapp we use [https://github.com/atom/node-keytar](keytar) as a library to maintain a secure vault for sensible information. We use it wrapping the function listed below in DOC section.

### Prerequisite for using On Linux systems

Currently this library uses `libsecret` so you **may** need to install it before running Leapp.

Depending on your distribution, you will need to run the following command:

* Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libsecret-1-dev`
* Red Hat-based: `sudo yum install libsecret-devel`
* Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S libsecret`

## Supported versions

Each release of `keytar` includes prebuilt binaries for the versions of Node and Electron that are actively supported by these projects. Please refer to the release documentation for [Node](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) and [Electron](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/support) to see what is supported currently.

## Docs

Every function in keytar is **asynchronous** and returns a promise. The promise will be rejected with any error that occurs or will be resolved with the function's "yields" value. In Leapp we use the three methods listed below to save and store sensible information and to **avoid** keeping them anywhere in the code. The delete function is used when an **AWS Plain** session is removed from the list.

### getPassword(service, account)

Get the stored password for the `service` and `account`.

`service` - The string service name.

`account` - The string account name.

Yields the string password or `null` if an entry for the given service and account was not found.

### setPassword(service, account, password)

Save the `password` for the `service` and `account` to the keychain. Adds a new entry if necessary, or updates an existing entry if one exists.

`service` - The string service name.

`account` - The string account name.

`password` - The string password.

Yields nothing.

### deletePassword(service, account)

Delete the stored password for the `service` and `account`.

`service` - The string service name.

`account` - The string account name.

Yields `true` if a password was deleted, or `false` if an entry with the given service and account was not found.

## How can I find Leapp data in the Vault

Every key stored by Leapp in the vault has **Leapp** as the name. The account name shows the description of the element saved by our software.

## How Keytar translate to system vaults?

Keytar translate to the following system vaults depending on the OS:

- On macOS the passwords are managed by the Keychain. 
- On Linux they are managed by the Secret Service API/libsecret. 
- On Windows they are managed by Credential Vault.

# Multi-Factor Authentication

Leapp support Multi-factor Authentication for an AWS session being it Plain or Truster. 
The system will ask for the **MFA device arn** provided by AWS when creating/editing 
a plain user.

## Setup MFA in AWS

## Setup MFA in Leapp

## About MFA and Session durations 

There are 2 **environment variables** contained in Leapp which defines how a session 
is managed:

- *session duration*: defines **how often** the system will refresh your **temporary** credentials. [defaults to 1200s / 20min]
- *session token duration* defines **how long** the **session token** will be used for each *session duration* refresh action. [defaults to 36000s / 10h] 

(inserire una nota che parla dell'utilizzo del session token per MFA)

(spiegare che le credenziali che durano 10h sono salvate nel vault, sicure, ed utilizzate puntualmente per generare nuove credenziali associate all'account truster; queste ultime vengono scritte nel file di credenziali, non vengono salvate nel vault)




# HTTP/HTTPS in-app proxy

Leapp allows for HTTP/HTTPS protocols, specifying a proxy server to which the in-app requests are sent. Both authenticated and non authenticated proxy are supported. In the option panel you can configure protocol, url, port, and authentication information. See image below

![image](.github/images/options-proxy.png)

### Note for Azure Sessions

Leapp uses Azure CLI to authenticate the **User** to retrieve the tokens for the session. This means that you **must** configure your Azure proxy settings locally to allow the Azure CLI to do ```az login``` properly, as Leapp is no responsible for that.

This extends generally to all CLIs and external tools that need to communicate over Internet behind a proxy configuration.

# Logs

By default, Leapp writes logs to the following locations:

- on Linux: ~/.config/**Leapp**/logs/log.log
- on macOS: ~/Library/Logs/**Leapp**/log.log
- on Windows: %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\**Leapp**\\logs\\log.log

Logs are structured in the following way:
=======

```
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss.mmm] [LEVEL] [rendered/system] [COMPONENT] MESSAGE {Useful Object / Stacktrace Err Object}
```

*Note: please always add logs whenever possible to any issue you want to fill to enable the team identify the problem quickly*

# Quick List
Quick list is the component in Leapp that helps you manage all your sessions
together. You'll probably pass most of your time here so this is a quick 
list tutorial on how it works!
